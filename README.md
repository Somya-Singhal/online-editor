In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### About Project

Create an online code editor for HTML, CSS, JS code snippets using only HTML, CSS, and

For any developer, be it amateur or professional, often the liberty of using a local code
editor may be unavailable. As online code editors are fast, efficient, and greatly popular, it is
a familiar tool among developers. If you have used one, ever wondered how it can be made?
This module will guide you through the process that can be followed to build your own
code editor for HTML, CSS, JS code snippets.

### High level Approach
High-Level Approach
This module consists of the following milestones:
>> Creating the structural aspect of code editor using HTML, CSS
>> Implementation of core functionalities and other frontend features using React
>> Publish to GitHub and finally host your deployed code editor.

### Applications

>> For online interviews/hiring: With online code editors, you can do interviews with
ease. It helps to see candidates’ approach towards solutions and work with code.
>> Prototyping: You can validate your ideas and get instant feedback from users as
